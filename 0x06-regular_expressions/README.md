# A regular expression (regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is a powerful tool used for string matching and manipulation in various programming languages and text editors.
# Regular expressions allow you to find, replace, or validate strings based on specific patterns.
# Metacharacters: These are special characters that have a specific meaning in regular expressions. Most used metacharacters include:

* . (dot): Matches any single character except newline.
* *: Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character.
* +: Matches one or more occurrences of the previous character.
* ?: Matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character.
* | (pipe): Acts like an OR operator to match either of the expressions around it.
* []: Represents a character class, matching any one of the characters inside the brackets.
* (): Creates a group, capturing or grouping parts of the regex pattern.
* Anchors: These are used to specify positions in the text:

* ^: Matches the start of a line.
* $: Matches the end of a line.
* Quantifiers: These define the number of occurrences of a character or group:

* {n}: Matches exactly n occurrences of the previous character or group.
* {n,}: Matches n or more occurrences of the previous character or group.
* {n,m}: Matches at least n and at most m occurrences of the previous character or group.
