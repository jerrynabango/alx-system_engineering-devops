# Loops, conditions and parsing
# Loops
===================================
* while loop: It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
* until loop: It repeatedly executes a block of code until the specified condition becomes true.
* for loop is a control flow statement that allows you to iterate over a sequence of items, such as elements in an array or a list of words. It is a useful construct for performing repetitive tasks with a known number of iterations.
# Parsing refers to the process of analyzing and extracting meaningful information from structured or unstructured data. The data can be in various formats, such as text, JSON, XML, CSV, HTML

# Conditions are statements that evaluate to either true or false. They are used to control the flow of a program, allowing it to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether the condition is true or false.
