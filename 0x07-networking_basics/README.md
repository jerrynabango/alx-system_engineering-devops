# OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers.
* The seven layers of the OSI model, from the highest are:

1. Application Layer: This layer is responsible for providing network services directly to the user or application. It deals with protocols and processes related to applications, such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer applications.

2. Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, compression, and encryption, ensuring that data from the application layer of one system can be understood by the application layer of another system.

3. Session Layer: The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications. It manages the communication sessions, which are logical connections between two systems.

4. Transport Layer: The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between hosts. It ensures reliable and error-checked data delivery and provides flow control, segmentation, and reassembly of data.

5. Network Layer: The network layer deals with routing and forwarding data packets across multiple networks. It determines the best path for data transmission between source and destination hosts.

6. Data Link Layer: The data link layer is responsible for reliable data transfer between two directly connected devices on the same network. It handles framing, physical addressing, and error detection.

7. Physical Layer: The physical layer deals with the physical medium over which data is transmitted. It specifies the hardware, cabling, and signaling used to transmit raw bits over a network.

# The OSI model serves as a conceptual guide for designing and implementing network protocols and communication systems.
